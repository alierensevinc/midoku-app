- **Easy Customization:** Simply replace placeholders like `[APP_NAME]` and `[HERO_TITLE]` to get started immediately.

## 🛠️ Setup & Customization

Follow these steps to use the template:

1. **Download the Files:** Clone this repository or download it as a zip file.
2. **Update Information:**
   Open `index.html`, `privacy-policy.html`, and `terms-and-conditions.html` in a text editor (e.g., VS Code).
   Replace the bracketed placeholders (`[PLACEHOLDER]`) with your app's specific information.

## 🌐 Deploying with GitHub Pages

You can host this project for free using GitHub Pages. Regarding your question:

> **Note:** GitHub Pages automatically serves **`index.html`** as the main entry point for your site. The `README.md` file is used only for displaying project information on the GitHub repository page and will not interfere with your live website. Your site will launch correctly using `index.html`.

**Deployment Steps:**

1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
3. Select **Pages** from the left sidebar.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, ensure **Source** is set to `Deploy from a branch`.
5. For **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
6. Click **Save**.

In a few minutes, GitHub will provide you with the live URL for your site (e.g., `https://username.github.io/project-name/`).
